# About the project

Sticky Notes is an application for Android platform which allows users to 
make some notes and store 'em locally. The app has a lot of great features 
for management, storing and editing of user notes. 

### What's happening there?

At first, this was one of my curriculum projects, made in 2016. The app was 
a client for the backend [^1]. 

[^1]: Backend was made with `Python`+`Flask`+`PostgreSQL`

Besides notes, the app had such features as contacts management (something 
like "Friends" in social networks), notes sharing and shared editing. Also, 
I had planned to add comments functionality for shared notes, but then 
I abandoned this project for several years. 

I started my software engineering career then, so I didn't have so much 
free time (and desire) to continue the project [^2]. 

[^2]: My work turned out to be much more interesting ðŸ˜‰

After almost 7 years, in the end of 2022, I decided to turn the Sticky Notes 
into a small portfolio project ðŸ™‚
